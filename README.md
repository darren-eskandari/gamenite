User Stories

Gamenite is an app that helps users smoothly organize tabletop gaming meetups. 

Users can build networks of gaming friends, organize their game libraries, and find local tabletop events, and host their own game nights.

We use the Boardgames Atlas API to build user libraries and plan the perfect game night.

The Usersâ€™ game library needs to store the id, name, and thumbnail from the API to display the basics, then link to the API for all other info.

The Events model will pull number of players and playtime from the API. Eventually adding game mechanics and description as well.

The Users model will eventually be expanded to add a boolean for Game Stores and other event spaces that host public game meetups. Comments will be added to the Events model as the first stretch goal.API
